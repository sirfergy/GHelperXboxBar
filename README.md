# G-Helper Xbox Game Bar Widget

An Xbox Game Bar widget that lets you switch [G-Helper](https://github.com/seerge/g-helper)
performance profiles (Silent / Balanced / Turbo / Custom 1 / Custom 2) and toggle the
XG Mobile (XGM) GPU without leaving your game — press **Win+G**, click a button, done.

## How it works

G-Helper already registers global hotkeys for every performance profile in
`InputDispatcher.cs`:

| Hotkey (default)         | G-Helper action                  |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Alt + F17`   | `SetPerformanceMode(0)` Balanced |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Alt + F18`   | `SetPerformanceMode(1)` Turbo    |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Alt + F16`   | `SetPerformanceMode(2)` Silent   |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Alt + F19`   | `SetPerformanceMode(3)` Custom 1 |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Alt + F20`   | `SetPerformanceMode(4)` Custom 2 |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Alt + F21`   | Toggle XGM (eGPU)                |

These are pre-registered when G-Helper starts (no user configuration required).
This widget synthesizes those key combos with `SendInput`, so **no changes to
G-Helper are needed** — it just has to be running.

The modifier keys are configurable in G-Helper via the `modifier_keybind_alt`
AppConfig setting; the widget reads that same config file (if present) so custom
modifiers are honoured.

## Architecture

Xbox Game Bar widgets must be UWP apps, which are sandboxed and cannot call
`SendInput` or launch arbitrary processes. So the solution contains three
projects, as is standard for packaged Game Bar widgets that need desktop access:

```
GHelperXboxBar.sln
├── GHelperXboxBar/           UWP (C# / XAML) — the widget UI
├── GHelperHotkey/            .NET desktop EXE — sends the SendInput hotkeys
└── GHelperXboxBar.Package/   Windows App Packaging project (MSIX) that hosts
                              both, declares the Xbox Game Bar widget
                              extension and the windows.fullTrustProcess
                              extension.
    └── Public/               REQUIRED empty-ish folder referenced by the
                              widget AppExtension's PublicFolder attribute.
                              If this folder is missing from the produced
                              MSIX, Windows silently drops the AppExtension
                              registration and the widget never appears in
                              the Game Bar widget menu.
```

The UWP widget stores the requested profile index in `ApplicationData.LocalSettings`
and then calls `FullTrustProcessLauncher.LaunchFullTrustProcessForCurrentAppAsync`.
`GHelperHotkey.exe` starts, reads that setting, synthesizes the correct
`Ctrl+Shift+Alt+F1x` combination via `SendInput`, and exits. G-Helper's keyboard
hook receives it and flips the profile.

## Building via GitHub Actions (no local toolchain required)

The repo ships a `build-msix` workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) that runs
on `windows-2022` (pinned — `windows-latest` was upgraded to Server 2025 and
no longer ships a UAP-capable Windows 10 SDK). The runner already has
VS 2022 Build Tools + UWP + MSIX SDKs
pre-installed). It:

1. Generates placeholder visual assets (`build/Generate-PlaceholderAssets.ps1`).
2. Creates an ephemeral self-signed code-signing cert.
3. Restores and builds the MSIX for both `x64` and `ARM64`.
4. Uploads `.msix` + `.cer` as workflow artifacts.

Push to GitHub, open the **Actions** tab, grab the artifact from the latest run,
unzip, trust the `.cer` (`Import-Certificate … -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\TrustedPeople`),
then `Add-AppxPackage .\GHelperXboxBar.Package_*.msix`.

## Building locally



- Either **Visual Studio 2022 (17.8+)** with the *UWP development* and
  *.NET desktop development* workloads, **or** the free headless
  **Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools** with the equivalent build workloads
  (`Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.UniversalBuildTools` +
  `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.ManagedDesktopBuildTools` + Win10 SDK 19041).
- Windows 10 version 2004 (19041) or Windows 11

### Option A — Visual Studio IDE

1. Open `GHelperXboxBar.sln` in Visual Studio.
2. Right-click `GHelperXboxBar.Package` → **Set as Startup Project**.
3. Enable **Developer Mode** in Windows Settings → Privacy & security → For developers.
4. Build configuration: `Release | x64` (or `ARM64`).
5. Right-click the Package project → **Publish → Create App Packages…**
   - Choose **Sideloading**, generate a self-signed cert if you don't have one.
6. Install the produced `.msix` (or `.msixbundle`) by double-clicking it, or run:
   ```powershell
   Add-AppxPackage -Path .\AppPackages\GHelperXboxBar.Package_*_Test\GHelperXboxBar.Package_*.msix
   ```
7. Trust the self-signed cert: double-click the `.cer` next to the msix, install
   into **Local Machine → Trusted People**.

### Option B — Build Tools only (no IDE)

```powershell
# From a "Developer PowerShell for VS 2022" window
./build/Generate-PlaceholderAssets.ps1    # one-time, unless you have real PNGs
msbuild GHelperXboxBar.sln /t:Restore,Build `
  /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64 `
  /p:UapAppxPackageBuildMode=SideloadOnly `
  /p:AppxPackageSigningEnabled=true `
  /p:PackageCertificateKeyFile=GHelperXboxBar.Package\GHelperXboxBar.Package_TemporaryKey.pfx
```

## Enable in Game Bar

1. Make sure **G-Helper is running**.
2. Press **Win+G** to open Xbox Game Bar.
3. Click the **Widget menu** button (≡) in the top bar → find **G-Helper Profiles** → click to pin.
4. Optionally pin it to the home bar (the star icon).

## Customising the hotkeys

If you've changed `modifier_keybind_alt` or any of the `keybind_profile_N` keys
in G-Helper's `%APPDATA%\GHelper\config.json`, the widget will pick those up
automatically on launch. To force a re-read, click the ⟳ refresh icon in the
widget's top-right.
